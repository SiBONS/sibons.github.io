                <p>Considering all the professions we have in this world, all have similar traits that an individual need to have.
                    I do not consider myself having all of them, but in the moment when you are aware that you love what you do and help
                    other people understand something, it is a "blessing" when you find a solution to a problem.</p>
                    <p>First of all you need to be a very curious person to achieve some obstacles that are not familiar to you. Your task is
                        to explain to yourself, then to others. You definitely have someone that has small grasp what is going on and some people
                        that are not interested when comes to IT things.
                        To be a successful IT enthusiast, as I call myself, you need to be resilient and understandable to others.</p>
                
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be patient and write things down with your own words; techy terminology will come later with your experience</li>
                            <li>Sometimes you need to take a break so your brain can process the information that you acknowledged. Take the time off from your computer
                                and do something that is not related to IT. IT will click the next day and you will be able to understand the concepts and 
                                put them into practice and also help people that are not that fortunate to grasp them.</li>
                                <li>You need to take some time in the nature as we are connected to the air, trees, bees because it will replenish your organism.</li>
                                <li>Take things systematically as if you do multiple things at a time, your system will burnout in the comparison of your processor of the 
                                    computer, mobile or laptop.</li>
                                    <li>Communicate clear to the person that has the issue, ask the questions so that you can isolate the problem.</li>
                        </ul>
                <p>
                    These things are not easy to incorporate as we are always in the rush. If the people are inpatient, do ever what is in your power to 
                    calm them down. If you have the problem, it is easier. If you work with different personalities and their stuff is urgent, adapt to the situation. Politeness and understanding resolves the problem 95% of the time. If the individual is not easy to cooperate, sometimes you need
                    to give up and pass it on to more experienced colleague. Also you can learn to them how they handled these kind of situations.</p>
                
                <p>Other thing that is crucial is that you need to pick a niche. There are a lot of IT jobs and you need to ask yourself questions what is
                    that you most enjoy the most.</p>
